# Audit Management System

## Overview

This is a comprehensive web-based audit management system built with Flask that provides role-based access control for managing organizational audits. The system supports four distinct user roles (Admin, Supervisor, Auditor, and Auditee) with specialized workflows for audit planning, execution, findings management, and corrective action tracking.

The application focuses on streamlining the audit process from initial planning through final reporting, with emphasis on compliance tracking, document management, and audit trail maintenance. It provides dashboards, notifications, and comprehensive reporting capabilities to support effective audit management across organizations.
