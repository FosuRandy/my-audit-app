Here’s a clear, step-by-step procedure of how the audit management should typically flow from a supervisor assigning it to an auditor interaction with auditee tailored for an internal corporate audit process (like in your telecom audit management system).

1. Audit Assignment Phase
Supervisor’s Role
Identify the Need for an Audit
Trigger: Scheduled (annual/quarterly), risk-based, or ad hoc request from management/regulators.

Define Audit Scope & Objectives
What’s being audited (process, department, system)?
Purpose (compliance, performance, fraud detection, etc.).
Select an Auditor or Audit Team
Match auditor’s expertise to audit subject.
Avoid conflicts of interest.
Assign the Audit in the System
Enter assignment into the AMS (Audit Management System).

Provide:
scope & objectives
Audit criteria & standards
Expected start and end dates
Resources & tools needed
Send Notification to Auditor
System automatically sends email/system alert to the assigned auditor.

2. Auditor’s Preparation Phase
Auditor’s Role
Acknowledge Assignment
Confirm receipt of task in the system.
Review the Scope & Objectives
Understand exactly what needs to be audited.
Review Background Information
Gather previous audit reports, incident logs, risk registers, regulatory requirements.

Develop the Audit Plan
Break down the audit into activities and timeline.
Prepare audit checklists, sampling plans, and data request lists
Coordinate with Auditee
Notify auditee of planned audit date and requirements.
Request necessary documents and access permissions in advance.

3. Pre-Audit Planning & Approval
Supervisor’s Role
Review Auditor’s Plan
Check that scope, methodology, and timelines align with objectives.
Approve or Request Changes
Approval triggers readiness for fieldwork.

Auditee → Auditor (Information & Access Provision)
Receive Audit Notification
Acknowledge planned audit date and requirements.
Prepare Required Documents
Submit requested policies, procedures, logs, transaction data.
Arrange Access
Ensure auditor has physical/system access to relevant locations or platforms.
Respond to Clarifications
Answer any preliminary queries from auditor.
